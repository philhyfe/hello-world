## This is a practice for me

I am Ifekiiku Phillips, an **AWS certified professional** focusing on *cloud architecture*.
I am an entry level employee with 0 years of work experience, but during my course of study at **ALX Africa** and **AWS Academy**, I have:
1. Created a VPC
2. Used cloud formation to deploy infrastructure as code
3.  Used codecommit and codepipeline to save cloud formation templte and automate deployment.
